## Overview

PromCon 2016 will be the first conference around the
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) monitoring system. It will take
place from August 25 - 26 at [Google Berlin](https://goo.gl/maps/a9cCmgbsq7L2)
and will be a single-track event with space for 80 attendants. All talks will
be recorded and published after the event to create maximum exposure.

PromCon aims to connect Prometheus users and developers from around the world
in order to exchange knowledge, best practices, and experience gained around
using Prometheus. We also want to collaborate to build a community and grow
professional connections around systems and service monitoring.

We are looking forward to seeing you at PromCon 2016!
