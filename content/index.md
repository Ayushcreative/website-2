## PromCon - The Prometheus Conference

PromCon aims to connect Prometheus users and developers from around the world
in order to exchange knowledge, best practices, and experience gained around
using Prometheus. We also want to collaborate to build a community and grow
professional connections around systems and service monitoring.

[PromCon 2016](/2016-berlin/) was the first conference around the
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) monitoring system. Many more are to
follow and we are looking forward to seeing you at the next PromCon!
