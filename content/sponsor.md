## Become a sponsor

As a community conference with a minimal entrance fee, we will depend
on sponsors for making PromCon possible. We will especially need to
cover the following expenses:

  * Professional video recordings of all talks</li>
  * Catering for 80 attendants</li>
  * An evening after-party</li>
  * Printed materials, banners, lanyards, etc.</li>

Do you want to help make this happen and <b>get your company featured in
videos, banners, and printed materials?</b> Please register to be notified
below and we will contact you when we have defined detailed sponsorship
conditions:
