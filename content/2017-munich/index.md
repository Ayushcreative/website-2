## Overview

PromCon 2017 will be the second conference around the Prometheus monitoring
system. It will take place from August 17 - 18 at Google Munich and will be a
single-track event with space for 200 attendants. All talks will be recorded and
published after the event to create maximum exposure.

PromCon aims to connect Prometheus users and developers from around the world in
order to exchange knowledge, best practices, and experience gained around using
Prometheus. We also want to collaborate to build a community and grow
professional connections around systems and service monitoring.

We are looking forward to seeing you at PromCon 2017!
