## Giovanni Gargiulo

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at HBC Digital and I've been working for the past two years in the Gilt Personalization team.

With twelve years of commercial experience architecting, building and delivering software, I’ve focused most of my career developing in Java. Since joining GILT two years ago, I’ve pleasantly switched to Scala and functional programming. I’m a DevOps advocate and passionate about quality, automation and attention to detail.
