## Goutham Veeramachaneni

I am a Student and a developer from India. But I like Ops more than Dev and Go more than all! My enthusiasm for Ops got me an internship on the infra team of a large company last summer where I worked on Production infrastructure and built the company's monitoring system on top of Prometheus.

That was my first encounter with production systems and Prometheus, and recently I started contributing to Prometheus again on the side and am now interning with CoreOS working on Prometheus' new storage engine.
