## Start Your Engines: White Box Monitoring for Your Load Tests

Speaker: [Alexander Schwartz](/2017-munich/speakers/alexander-schwartz/)

You think monitoring is only for production? Wrong: Add a metrics endpoint to your application to get insights during your load tests - and use them for free to monitor production!

This talk shows how to setup up the load testing tools JMeter and Gatling to push their metrics to Prometheus. It also makes the case to expose metrics as part of core application development instead of treating them as a small add-on before go-live.
