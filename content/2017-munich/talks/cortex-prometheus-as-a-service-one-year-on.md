## Cortex: Prometheus as a Service, One Year On

Speaker: [Tom Wilkie](/2017-munich/speakers/tom-wilkie/)

At PromCon 2016, I presented "Project Frankenstein: A multitenant, horizontally scalable Prometheus as a service". It's now one year later, and lots has changed - not least the name!  This talk will discuss what we've learnt running a Prometheus service for the past year, the architectural changes we made from the original design, and the improvements we've made to the Cortex user experience.
