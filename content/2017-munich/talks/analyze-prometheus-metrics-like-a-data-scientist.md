## Analyze Prometheus Metrics like a Data Scientist

Speaker: [Georg Ã–ttl](/2017-munich/speakers/georg-oettl/)

Gathering software metrics with Prometheus is great and easy. However, at some point there are too many timeseries to craft handwritten rule based alert systems. In this talk I will show how to export data from the Prometheus HTTP API, show how and what to analyze with open-source tools like R, Python SciPi and describe why DevOps and Whitebox Monitoring fits so great here. As an outlook I will show how to integrate/export timeseries to machine learning services.
