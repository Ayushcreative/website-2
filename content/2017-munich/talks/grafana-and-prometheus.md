## Grafana and Prometheus

Speaker: [Carl Bergquist](/2017-munich/speakers/carl-bergquist/)

Being the default dashboard for Prometheus I guess most of you already tried Grafana and created some graphs. But have you tried the table and heat map panels? Did you know that Grafana also offers multiple plugins to visualize and show your Prometheus data? What other tricks and optimizations are there?

We will also look at the major changes in Grafana since last PromCon and what we currently work on.
