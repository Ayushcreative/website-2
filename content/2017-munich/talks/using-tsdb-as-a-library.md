## Using TSDB as a library

Speaker: [Goutham Veeramachaneni](/2017-munich/speakers/goutham-veeramachaneni/)

This talk will be an introductory talk about using the new datastore as a library. It will be based on this blog: https://geekon.tech/content/post/tsdb-embeddable-timeseries-database/ with clearer and more verbose examples and a simple REST based timeseries demo at the end.

People will leave with:

* A clear understanding of how to use tsdb.
* The fundamentals that are needed to start contributing to the tsdb <--> Prometheus layer.
