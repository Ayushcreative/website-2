## Why We Love Prometheus Even Though I Hate It

Speaker: [Yaroslav Molochko](/2017-munich/speakers/yaroslav-molochko/)

At Anchorfree we had about 10 monitoring systems of different types. It was difficult to manage, we had 0 observability, as it was impossible to see whole picture. We decided to go with Prometheus full speed, migrated all the major and minor systems to it. This was not easy move, as we faced with a bunch of problems, fundamental misunderstandings, and resistance.

In this talk I would like to highlight the problems we faced, how we solved it. Answer why we still hate Prometheus and why we love it with all our hearts at the same time.
