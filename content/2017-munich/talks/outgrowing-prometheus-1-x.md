## Outgrowing Prometheus 1.x

Speaker: [Michal Witkowski](/2017-munich/speakers/michal-witkowski/)

We start off by presenting monitoring stack that we offer to SpatialOS customers with its unique properties and challenges of serving millions of metrics per scrape. We'll dive into the scaling pains of Prometheus 1, and the "stop gap" solutions we put in place to keep it rolling. Then we'll explore why we decided to adopt Prometheus 2 very early on, and how by running it side-by-side with Prometheus 1, we contributed back to the project with bug reports and repro cases. We'll close by discussing the impact of Prometheus 2 on our serving stack, and the future work that we're planning on top of TSDB.
