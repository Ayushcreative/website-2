## Integrating Prometheus and InfluxDB

Speaker: [Paul Dix](/2017-munich/speakers/paul-dix/)

This talk will look at the different integrations between InfluxDB and Prometheus. We'll dive into using InfluxDB for remote long term storage. Other examples will show how to use Kapacitor to scrape Prometheus metrics targets to pull data into InfluxDB and transform it on the fly to different schemas. Finally, we'll take a look at the upcoming enhancements to the Influx Query Language and possible implementation of PromQL within Influx itself for better long term integration of the two projects.
