## Scaling to a Million Machines with Prometheus

Digital Ocean hosts a public facing monitoring platform that runs on top of
Prometheus. We will discuss how we scale Prometheus up to millions of virtual
machines. How we manage and maintain the largest Prometheus cluster in the
world. Also how we do multi-tenancy in Prometheus.
