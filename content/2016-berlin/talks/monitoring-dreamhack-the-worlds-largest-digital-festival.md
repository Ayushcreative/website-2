## Monitoring DreamHack - The World's Largest Digital Festival

Speaker: [Christian Svensson](/2016-berlin/speakers/christian-svensson/)

If you are operating the network for 10,000's of demanding gamers, you need to
really know what is going on inside your network. Oh, and everything needs to
be built from scratch in just five days.

If you have never heard about DreamHack before, here is the pitch: Bring
20,000 people together and have the majority of them bring their own computer.
Mix in professional gaming (eSports), programming contests, and live music
concerts. The result is the world's largest festival dedicated solely to
everything digital.
