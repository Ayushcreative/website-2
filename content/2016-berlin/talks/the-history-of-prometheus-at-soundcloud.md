## The History of Prometheus at SoundCloud

Speaker: [Tobias Schmidt](/2016-berlin/speakers/tobias-schmidt/)

The way SoundCloud monitors its services and infrastructure has dramatically
changed over the last couple of years. Monitoring, alerting, and being on-call
is now deeply ingrained in every engineering team and we have learned a lot on
the way.

This talk will describe our transition from an ops team to a "you build it,
you own it" approach, why we needed something like Prometheus, as well as how
Prometheus helped us to achieve that and highlight a few success and failure
stories.
