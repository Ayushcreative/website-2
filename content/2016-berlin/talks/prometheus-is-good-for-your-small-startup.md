## Prometheus Is Good for Your Small Startup

Speaker: [Ignacio P. Carretero](/2016-berlin/speakers/ignacio-carretero/)

ShuttleCloud is a small startup specialized in email and contacts migrations.
We are proud of having Gmail, Gcontacts and Comcast among our clients.

You don't need to have a big fleet to embrace Prometheus. In this talk we'll
explain our journey from having near-zero monitoring to having a comfortable
cost-effective in-house monitoring stack based on Prometheus.
