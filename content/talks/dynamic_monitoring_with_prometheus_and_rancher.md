## Dynamic Monitoring with Prometheus and Rancher

Both Prometheus and Rancher have extremely active communities and were born
from the same requirement to support the newer dynamic infrastructures.
 
This talk will focus on how Rancher and its community are leveraging the power
of Prometheus for monitoring both hosts and applications, and how we are
leveraging Prometheus's dynamic server discovery to minimise the amount of
static configuration and maintenance.
