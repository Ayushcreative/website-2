## 10x Improvement for Kubernetes Performance

Scalability is one of the important factors that make a successful distributed
system. At CoreOS, we love Kubernetes and help drive the project forward
through upstream contributions. Learn how we analyzed Kubernetes cluster
performance to gain insight into cluster behavior under large workloads and
learn where there are performance issues. See how we used Prometheus for
improving Kubernetes scheduler performance by 10x.
