## Explore Your Prometheus Data in Grafana

Speaker: [David Kaltschmidt](/2018-munich/speakers/david-kaltschmidt/)

Grafana is the de-facto dashboarding solution for Prometheus. Now imagine you received a page. Grafana is often the starting point for your incident response. You look at a time series panel, form a hypothesis, and would like to dive deeper. We've built a whole new section that allows you to do just that by iterating quickly through Prometheus queries while leaving your dashboards intact. I'll show-case our new Explore UI and how it can fit into your workflows for both troubleshooting and data exploration.
