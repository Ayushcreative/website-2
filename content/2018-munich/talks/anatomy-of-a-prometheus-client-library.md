## Anatomy of a Prometheus Client Library

Speaker: [Brian Brazil](/2018-munich/speakers/brian-brazil/)

Prometheus client libraries are notably different from most other options in the space. In order to get the best insights into your applications it helps to know how they are designed, and why they are designed that way. This talk will look at how client libraries are structured, how that makes them easy to use, some tips for instrumentation, and why you should use them even if you aren't using Prometheus.
