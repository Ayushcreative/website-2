## Harsh Agarwal

I am an undergraduate student from IIT Hyderabad and a developer from India.

I was introduced to Prometheus when I built my college's monitoring infrastructure on top of Prometheus.

This motivated me to contribute to Prometheus and am now a Google Summer of Code 2018 intern working on Prometheus' benchmarking and e2e testing tool.
