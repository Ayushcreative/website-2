## Cody Boggs

Cody is an infrastructure nerd through and through, focused on building teams (and occasionally systems) that provide the reliable and performant backbone for all manner of distributed SaaS solutions. Thoroughly obsessed with all things observability, he is currently a Principal Engineer with the FreshTracks.io team at CA Technologies in Boulder, CO. In his spare time he can be found running from his water-balloon-wielding children, or working in the garden until he resembles a particularly lumpy patch of dirt.
