## Diversity scholarships

As part of our efforts to make PromCon more inclusive and diverse, we are giving
away free tickets as well as potentially travel funding to diversity applicants
this year.

Scholarship awards are based on need and merit, and are not guaranteed. We will
decide based on available funding to what extend we can reimburse travel in
addition to providing free tickets.
