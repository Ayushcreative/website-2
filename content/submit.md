## Submit a talk

The PromCon Call for Papers (CFP) is open for talk submissions until April 30,
2016, and we encourage you to submit a talk!

<a class="btn btn-default btn-lg" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1b7lq7-h8f0JRPThl6oc3Q70YsbzR__FcGNKbCvdetow/viewform" target="_blank" role="button">Submit Talk</a>

We are accepting talk proposals around the following topics, with experience
levels ranging from beginner to expert:

* Integrating with Prometheus</li>
* Using Prometheus</li>
* Prometheus use case reports</li>
* Prometheus fundamentals and philosophy</li>
* Prometheus internals and core development</li>

**Speaker reimbursements:** Since PromCon is a non-commercial community
conference, speaker reimbursements for travel and accommodation will depend on
available funding. If you want to give a talk but cannot get reimbursed by your
company, please submit a proposal anyway and let us know in the "Additional
note to the selection committee" field. We will then let you know what we can
offer.
