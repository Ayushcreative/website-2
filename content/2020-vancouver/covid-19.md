## Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Notice

After discussions with many community members, we have made the difficult
decision to **cancel PromCon North America 2020** due to the uncertainty around the
global pandemic and our ability to assemble the speakers, sponsors, and
attendees necessary for a successful event. CNCF remains deeply committed to
engaging with the Prometheus community and we are looking forward to coming
together in person, hopefully in 2021.

**We are exploring options for a virtual event and we will share details with the
community soon.**

Please find the details regarding the next steps below.

## CFP

If you have submitted a talk proposal through the CFP, we will be in touch
shortly.

## Sponsorships

If you are currently a sponsor we will connect with you shortly.

If you have any questions, email events@cncf.io.
