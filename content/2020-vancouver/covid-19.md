## Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Notice

**PromCon North America is currently scheduled to take place as planned July 16 - 17, 2020 in Vancouver, Canada.** We are continuously monitoring the COVID-19/Novel Coronavirus situation, and are in regular communication with the [Westin Bayshore](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/yvrwi-the-westin-bayshore-vancouver/). If it is determined that we cannot move forward with the event due to government restrictions and/or a continued concern for the welfare of our attendees, we will update all event participants in a timely manner, **and issue full attendee registration refunds, and sponsorship refunds**.

Assuming the event does continue, we will keep the safety and health of our attendees as our top priority on-site and will institute all safety measures as recommended by the WHO and the CDC at that time to ensure everyone's health and well-being. This will most likely include measures as detailed below.

## Onsite Safety Measures

* Plentiful sanitation stations onsite with alcohol-based hand sanitizer, wipes, and tissue
* Signage encouraging attendees to practice Respiratory Hygiene & Social Distancing
* A no-handshake policy at the event
* Regularly sanitizing all surfaces through the event space
* Sanitizing speaker microphones between each speaker's use
* Requesting anyone that is sick to refrain from attending or to seek medical attention right away should they get sick onsite
