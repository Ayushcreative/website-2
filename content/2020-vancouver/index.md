## Overview

PromCon North America 2020 is the fifth installment of the PromCon conference dedicated to the [Prometheus monitoring system](https://prometheus.io/). It will take place July 16-17, 2020 (Thu & Fri) at the [Westin Bayshore](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/yvrwi-the-westin-bayshore-vancouver/) hotel in Vancouver as a single-track event with space for 600 attendees.

PromCon aims to connect Prometheus users and developers from around the world in order to exchange knowledge, best practices, and experience gained around using Prometheus. We also want to collaborate to build a community and grow professional connections around systems and service monitoring.
