## Overview

PromCon North America 2021 is the sixth installment of the PromCon conference dedicated to the [Prometheus monitoring system](https://prometheus.io/). It will take place in the summer of 2021 at the [Westin Bayshore](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/yvrwi-the-westin-bayshore-vancouver/) hotel in Vancouver as a single-track event with space for 600 attendees.

PromCon aims to connect Prometheus users and developers from around the world in order to exchange knowledge, best practices, and experience gained around using Prometheus. We also want to collaborate to build a community and grow professional connections around systems and service monitoring.
